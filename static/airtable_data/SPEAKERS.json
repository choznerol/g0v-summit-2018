He is currently a Strategic Partnerships Specialist for the Digital Collaboration team with the Government of Canada. Derek and the team along with partners across the globe are creating a digital public space constructed on the foundations of open source platforms. It currently operates at the intersection of open international government (policy) and digital government movements (technology) where organizations are working together to build the space - together.\n\nThe digital public space is a major step toward a more innovative and open way of identifying and co-creating programs, engagements, and research across the globe. It is designed for co-creation in all forms, but more importantly, it demonstrates the beginning of a cultural shift of horizontal governance and decision-making.",
