This process helps strengthen the quality of stakeholder collaborations and better inform our public policies. We believe that multi-stakeholder governance processes can reinforce the trust between citizens and the government.\n\nThe PO Network serves to drive cultural change; it plays a key role in Taiwan’s Open Government scene. POs are deeply involved in the conversation with civic society and governmental divisions, by tackling cross-ministerial issues with wider stakeholders openly and creatively. PO Network is a network of around 70 civil servants in the central government.",

Outcomes, best practices, and lessons learned will be discussed. The workshop will also include discussion of several outstanding questions associated with a CEL computer science classroom. Discussion will be facilitated through a series of activities used in the classroom to foster communication and teamwork. ",

  "ABSTRACT_EN": "The participatory democracy movement in the United States hasn’t swept into power via municipal elections like it did in Madrid, nor did it secure a foothold at the national level like it did in Taiwan. But what we do have is participatory budgeting programs in over a dozen US cities. Participatory Budgeting (PB) enables residents of cities to directly decide how to spend part of a public budget. New York City’s PB program is the largest in the country, allocated over $40 million, which is about .05% of the city’s budget. It’s small but it’s something. \n\nBy mixing together elements of vTaiwan’s public consultation process, Madrid’s Consul citizen-participation app, our own transparency software, our team is building an more integrated open source toolset for New York City that we hope will bring Asia, Europe and America's participatory democracy communities into closer collaboration around our shared goal of developing more transparent and participatory governments.",

We created a service which uses the API developed by Indiana University called Botometer. In two days, the project has gone viral in Brazil and it has been accessed by more than 200 thousand people, demonstrating there is a large demand for awareness regarding how manipulation in social media occurs. \n\nThe project has currently two parts: the online tool and the creation of comprehensive education and awareness raising materials on how bots and social media manipulation are related. We are providing media literacy materials to inform every user of our project, including in terms of legal issues and how the Judiciary is dealing with bots. We intend to share what we have learned with the use of this online tool so far and also raise further applications for it by exchanging with colleagues that might have developed other successful instruments in this sense.",

  "ABSTRACT": "開放政府、公民科技在近十年內襲捲全球，成了新形態的公民運動。從台灣生根發起的零時政府，不論在社群規模、治理模式與政治影響力上，都成為全球公民科技所矚目的對象。在過去兩年，我隨著開放文化基金會和社群伙伴，走訪了世界著名的公民科技相關會議（Code for America、OGP、TICTeC、Datensummit、PDF），也在台灣舉辦了 Civic Tech Fest 。這場短講，將分析各個會議對於公民科技的不同想像，並比較台灣經驗在全球公民科技浪潮中的特殊地位，最後，以世界為鏡，提出一些反思。",

  "ABSTRACT": "在臺灣，死刑是一個非常難被討論的議題。首先，民調指出約有八成左右的民眾支持死刑，民意相當的懸殊；其次，死刑也是討論時會變得非常「極化」的議題，無論支持者或反對者都顯現出強烈的意見認同。每當重大刑案發生，死刑議題就變得更加難被冷靜的看待。然而，民間團體「廢除死刑推動聯盟」還是決定跨出一步，不再辯論「廢死與否」，而是設定「死刑替代方案」作為審議的主題，走遍全台灣各縣市，也舉辦了特殊關係人的場次。",

The session will argue on the importance of participatory processes, human-centered design, systems mapping, and ethnographic approaches in understanding context, dissecting the challenges that needs to be solved, and prioritizing key design variables that are important to be considered to ensure that open data programs are relevant to the needs of people and their communities, and with strong likelihood of success and sustainability.\n\nThe session will talk about both success and failures and also both the sweet and bitter realizations that came out of the experience.  The session will challenge participants to think about their own practice and reflect on the key lessons that they have also learned in the design and implementation of their programs. The session will conclude with a few rules of thumb in designing and implementing civic technologies, including open data, to ensure that outcomes desired from these interventions will be realized and will benefit participants and stakeholders.",
